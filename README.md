# Whack-a-mole-unity3d

A whack a mole game written in c# with asp.net framework.
It was one of the projects I have worked on with 3 software developer apprentices in same team.

# Lessons learned

First time working in a team of software developer apprentices.
Sharing our ideas and noting down the best way to create the whack a mole game.
I coded on the part where the mole appears randomly.

# Potential future features

The score and timer should be at the top of the screen instead of underneath the holes, to make it more user friendly.
Possibility of recording all scores and show the score the user had achieved and the current highest score.
