# Whack-a-mole-unity3d

A whack a mole game written in c# with asp.net framework.
It was one of the projects I have worked on with 3 software developer apprentices in same team.

# Lessons learned

First time working in a team of software developer apprentices.
Sharing our ideas and noting down the best way to create the whack a mole game.
I coded on the part where the mole appears randomly.

# Potential future features

The timer should be at the top of the screen instead of underneath the holes, to make it more user friendly.
The holes where the moles randomly appear could be 3d instead of 2d to make it look realistic.
